# Satellite_simulation
My program simulates movement of satellite. For better visability I have created the function which gives opportunity to hide model of Earth.\n
If you want to start using it you should just install libraries:\n
pip install matplotlib\n
pip install numpy\n
pip install scypy\n
Then input data and enjoy\n
if you want to see eleptical orbit you should just increase speed
