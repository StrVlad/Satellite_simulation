# Satellite_simulation
My program simulates movement of satellite. For better visability I have created the function which gives opportunity to hide model of Earth.
If you want to start using it you should just install libraries:
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install scypy
Then input data and enjoy
If you want to see eleptical orbit you should just increase speed
